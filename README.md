# TIL
> Today I Learned

Inspired by [https://github.com/jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), I have decided to keep a list of new things I learn every day.

##Git
* [A better git diff](git/diff-so-fancy.md)
* [Change a commit timestamp](git/change-commit-timestamp.md)

#Vim
* [Resize vertical split](vim/resize-split.md)

#Ember JS
* [Handle permission errors](ember/no-auth-permission.md)
